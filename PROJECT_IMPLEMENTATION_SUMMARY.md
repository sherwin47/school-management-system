## 🔧 HOW TO USE THE NEW SYSTEMS

### 1️⃣ ADMISSION MANAGEMENT
**URL:** `/admin/admissions` (Admin) | `/parent/admissions` (Parent)

```typescript
// Parents submit applications
import { AdmissionEnquiryForm } from "@/components/admissions/admission-form";

function AdmissionPage() {
  return <AdmissionEnquiryForm onSuccess={() => navigate("/admissions/track")} />;
}

// Track status
import { AdmissionApplicationTracker } from "@/components/admissions/admission-tracker";

function TrackingPage() {
  return <AdmissionApplicationTracker application={app} />;
}
```

### 2️⃣ PAYMENT PROCESSING
**Payment after admission is confirmed:**

```typescript
import { UnifiedPaymentForm } from "@/components/payments/payment-form";

function PaymentPage() {
  return (
    <UnifiedPaymentForm
      gateway="razorpay"  // or "stripe"
      orderId="order_123"
      amount={5000}
      studentName="Aarav Sharma"
      email="parent@example.com"
      phone="9876543210"
      onSuccess={(paymentId) => {
        // Payment successful
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

### 3️⃣ SEND NOTIFICATIONS
**Notify users about admissions, payments, events:**

```typescript
import { notificationService } from "@/server/notifications";

// Send individual email
await notificationService.sendEmail(
  "parent@example.com",
  "Admission Confirmed",
  "<h1>Welcome!</h1>"
);

// Send from template (with variable replacement)
await notificationService.sendFromTemplate(
  "parent@example.com",
  "admission_confirmation",
  {
    parentName: "Rajesh",
    studentName: "Aarav",
    admittedGrade: "10",
    admissionFee: "5000"
  }
);

// Bulk send to all admitted students
await notificationService.sendBulk({
  channel: "email",
  templateId: "admission_confirmation",
  recipients: [
    { email: "p1@example.com", data: { ... } },
    { email: "p2@example.com", data: { ... } },
    // ... more parents
  ]
});
```
