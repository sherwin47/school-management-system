## 🎯 VERIFICATION STEPS

To test the admission system:

1. **Admin Flow:**
   ```
   → Go to /admin/admissions
   → View list of applications
   → Click on application to review
   → Verify documents
   → Approve/Reject/Waitlist
   ```

2. **Parent Flow:**
   ```
   → Go to /parent/admissions
   → View children's applications
   → Track status in real-time
   → Submit new application (if needed)
   → Pay admission fee
   ```

3. **Database Verification:**
   - Check `admission_applications` table for new records
   - Verify documents are stored in JSONB array
   - Check status transitions in `updated_at` field
   - View payment records in `payment_ledger`

## 📝 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### Key Features
1. **Multi-step form** with progress tracking
2. **Document verification workflow** with status tracking
3. **Waitlist management** with position tracking
4. **Admin review panel** with notes & actions
5. **Parent tracking** with real-time status updates
6. **Offer letter generation** with conditions & validity
7. **Fee collection** integration with existing ledger

### Design Decisions
- Stored documents as JSONB array for flexibility (not file storage)
- Status transitions: Draft → Submitted → Under Review → {Approved/Rejected/Waitlisted}
- Waitlist as separate status for better tracking
- Reused existing `payment_ledger` for fee collection
- Mock data for testing without live API calls

### Security & Compliance
- RBAC: Students/parents can only view own applications
- RLS policies: Authenticated users only
- Document verification: Admin approval required
- Parent contact verification: Email + phone validation
- GDPR ready: Structured data with clear retention policies
